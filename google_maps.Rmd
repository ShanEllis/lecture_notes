# Google Maps Tutorial

## What is Google Maps?

Google Maps is a navigation GPS system which allows the user to find the ideal route from one location to another.
It also displays estimated times of different navigation methods and basic traffic information.

## Getting Started

The first step to using Google Maps is finding it! You can access Google Maps by either searching "Google Maps"
on Google.com or by clicking on the lower left hand corner search tool and then typing in "Google Maps". A Google Maps icon should pop up.
