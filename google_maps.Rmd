# Google Maps Tutorial

## What is Google Maps?

Google Maps is a navigation GPS system which allows the user to find the ideal route from one location to another.
It also displays estimated times of different navigation methods and basic traffic information.

## Getting Started

The first step to using Google Maps is finding it! You can access Google Maps by either searching "Google Maps"
on Google.com or by clicking on the lower left hand corner search tool and then typing in "Google Maps". A Google Maps icon should pop up. 


This is what it should look like when googling "Google Maps"

Either method should generate the following image

To begin, start with the target destination - the place you want to go to. Enter that in the purple box shown below

Afterwards the following screen will appear

Click on the circular directions button shown by the purple designator

Google Maps will then ask for your starting location, where you currently are. If you have GPS enabled click on the My Location option, or if not then type in your starting address

The app will calculate the optimum route, and then ask for your mode of transportation. The options are outlined in purple

For this example I will choose the walking option. A graphic representation of the best route will appear. You can change which route you take by click on the options shown by the purple box
