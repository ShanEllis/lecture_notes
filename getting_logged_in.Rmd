# Getting Logged In

## Getting Started

In order to use a chromebook, we need two things.  The first, is access to wifi.  If you don't know how to set up wifi, check our next tutorial titled "How do you set up Wifi."  Second, we need a google account.  If you already have one, then just use it to sign into your chromebook.  If not, no worries, we can create one right now.

  1. First we must get to the right webpage.  Type in the following URL:https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en, or you can search up "How to sign up for google."  Select the option titled "Create your Google account" highlighted in red below:

  That should take you to the following page and step 2.

  2. Now we need to fill in some information.  First your name.  Next, we need a username.  Assuming you plan on using this email in the future, use a professional name, such as a combination of your first and last name.  The next step is a password.  For security, choose one that is different from your other passwords.  Enter it again in the next section to confirm.  Finally we need your birthday.  There are some extra options, but those can be changed later as needed.

Click next to continue.

  3. Congatulations.  Now you have an account with google.  You can use the same username and password to access your chromebook.
