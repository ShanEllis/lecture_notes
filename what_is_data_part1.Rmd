# What is data?

## Data are complex

The definition of Data is not as simple as a mere spreadsheet. Data refers to a wide assortment of
representations of different variables and comes in many forms.

## Forms of data
1. CSV files
2. Excel files
3. Images
4. Miscellaneous

The above, especially the first three options, lists the most popular forms of data that you will come in contact with.
Keep in mind that a lot of the data you will encounter will be of the fourth category. This is the most difficult form to work
with and thus will be explained in a separate document.
