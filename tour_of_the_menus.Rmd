# Chromebook Menu Tutorial

## What is the star menu?
The start menu is the means by which the user and a computer interact. It provides a central launching point for programs and performing other tasks. The start menu supplies a list of programs for the user to launch and a way to browse the internet immediately. 

## How to use it

Among the icons on the left side of the Chromebook screen, the start menu is a white rimmed circle that is located at the bottom left corner as shown in the image.
