#Creating a Repository

## Starting a Project
Every project on github starts with a repository.  Just like building a house, we need a frame to build our project in.  Projects are housed in repositories.  These repositories will hold all the necessary files and information needed for a project.  So let's get started making that repository.

*Step 1:* Find your way back to the homepage: https://github.com/.  Now that we've signed in, this page will be about you and the projects you work on.

*Step 2:* Look in the top right corner, near your profile picture/avatar.  There should be a plus sign.  Click on it, then select "new repository."

*Step 3:* Next we need to fill in some information.  Let's break it down into a couple steps.
*Step 3a:* First, a name for this repository.  Make it as cool or as dull as you would like.
*Step 3b:* Next, write a short little description for the project.  What is it about and what are your goals?
*Step 3c:* Next you can select whether you want the project to be public (visible to anyone) or private (visible only to those you choose.)  This depends on the project and your account.
*Step 3d:* Finally you have some options you can select, these automatically create files in your repository.  READMEs are vital for every project, they serve as descriptions, trouble shooters, and FAQs all at once.  I highly suggest checking that box off.

Cool.  Now we have created a repository.  It will be the base that houses your project.  It doesn't have anything in it just yet, but let's change that, shall we?
