A typical issue on GitHub contains some of this characteristics:
1. A title and description describing what the issue is about.
2. Color-coded labels that help you categorize and filter your issues.
3. A milestone that acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with project phases.
4. One assignee that is responsible for working on the issue.
5. Comments that allow anyone with access to the repository to provide feedback.

Also by using @mentions and references inside of an issue, you can notify other GitHub users.
