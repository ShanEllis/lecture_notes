# What is R used for?
R is a computing environment mainly used for statistical computing and graphics. While many users consider R as a statistics system, it is not limited to solely statistics. R's functionality can be extended with either official or user-created packages. Unlike other statistical tool kits that provide very specific tools, R is a very flexible language by design. R was developed around a true computer language, allowing users to define new functions and algorithms.
