# Tour of RStudio and RStudio Cloud
The RStudio Cloud interface will have an identical appearance to a locally installed instance of RStudio. 
![RStudio Cloud IDE]( https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21327023/27216220-bdefb308-5242-11e7-88bf-3fc78d86d34d.png)

## Console
The sub-window on the right-hand side is the console. This is where the user can test and run code line by line. The `>` symbol at the beginning of the line indicates the start of a new line of code. When a line of code is not completed correctly, the IDE wil return either an error message, or the next line will start with a `+` symbol, indicating incompletion and prompting for the rest of the code.

## Environment
On the upper right-hand side, the environment sub-window shows all of the variables and their values stored in the current project. 
![RStudio Cloud Environment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21327023/27216188-9c019f4a-5242-11e7-9769-a90da129a644.png)
As an example of what is stored in the environment window, type the following code into the console:
```
> a = 3
> b = matrix(0, nrow=3, ncol=3)
```
These two lines declares two variables, `a` and `b`. `a` is defined as an integer of the value of `3`, while `b` is defined as a 3 x 3 matrix of all 0's. Looking back in the environment window, it lists both `a` and `b` and their respective values.

## File Manager
On the lower right-hand side, the file manager shows the current directory and any files located there. The user can navigate to a different directory by clicking on the folders or `..` when available. Clicking on the folder shows its contents, whereas the double dots `..` exits the folder and returns to the previous directory.

Depending on the file, clicking on it will open a new text editor sub-window above the console. For example, a text file will open the editor while displaying its contents.

An important function of this window is its `Upload` button, which allows the user to upload scripts, programs, or data sets to cloud storage, which is then accessible by the RStudio Cloud session. 

## Toolbar
At the top of the IDE is the toolbar. Functions include opening a new file, quitting the current project, editing code, and building and debugging R programs.

## Menu
The menu button is always available for viewing the user's profile, changing settings, and logging out. The menu button is the ![RStudio Menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21327023/27216086-30d3917e-5242-11e7-89cc-b4947ba89422.png) icon. Clicking on it will pull up a blue sidebar on the right-hand side.
