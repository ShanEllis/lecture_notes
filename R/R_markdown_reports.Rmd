# R Markdown Reports
## What are R Markdown Reports?

R Markdown reports are text files made with R markdown. Each report document consists of three parts and frameworks:  
1. markdown for formatted text
2. `knitr` for embedded code
3. YAML for render options
 
When building an R Markdown report, the document is written in plain text. However, the contents of the document can be processed and rendered, such as executing code blocks or building graphics and plots. R Markdown reports are the finalized version of the document that is ready to be shared. This includes running and executing the code blocks, formatting the text, and saving it to a suitable file type. These three steps form the basis of _rendering_. 

## Getting Started  
R markdown files can be created by opening a plain text and saving the file with the _.Rmd_ file extension. The _.Rmd_ extension is necessary for R Studio to recognize the document as a R Markdown file. In RStudio Cloud, this can be done by going to the toolbar and clicking on _File_ > _New File_ > _Text File_.  This will open an empty text file in the text editor window.

As noted earlier, R Markdown relies on three frameworks to produce professional documents: markdown for formatted text, embedded code, and the YAML header.  

An overview of R Markdown documents can be found [here](https://github.com/chromebookdatascience/lecture_notes/blob/master/R/R_markdown.Rmd). 

Once the R Markdown document has been formatted with markdown, embedded with code blocks, and specified the target output with the YAML header, the document is ready to be rendered. This is as simple as going to the knit dropdown menu and selecting the appropriate output file type (but this will overwrite the `output:` option in the YAML header)

or using the `rmarkdown::render()` command in the terminal. If the first option is used, the desired R Markdown document must be open in the text editor. If the second option is used, the path to the R Markdown document must be specified with quotes inside of the parentheses, like `rmarkdown::render("/path/to/rmarkdown.Rmd")`.

## Summary
R Markdown reports are simply the finalized document after the R Markdown documents have been rendered and saved to the desired file format. However, the rendering process is automated by the `knitr` and `pandoc` packages, so updating the report is very easy. Updates are made by editing the raw R Markdown document, be it code or text, and then re-rendering the document.
