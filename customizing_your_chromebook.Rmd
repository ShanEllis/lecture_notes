# Customizing Your Chromebook

  Now that you've gotten access to your chromebook, it's time to make it yours.  There are a number of personalization options available to you, lets go through some of them.
  
# Languages

  You may be more comfortable working in another language.  If so, you can change your chromebook's language to match your own.  Here's how you do that:
  1. Go to the bottom left corner of the screen, as shown in the picture.  You will see a tool bar.  Click on it and a menu will pop up.
