# Customizing Your Chromebook

  Now that you've gotten access to your chromebook, it's time to make it yours.  There are a number of personalization options available to you, lets go through some of them.
  
# Languages

  You may be more comfortable working in another language.  If so, you can change your chromebook's language to match your own.  Here's how you do that:
  1. Go to the bottom left corner of the screen, as shown in the picture.  You will see a tool bar.  Click on it and a menu will pop up.

  2. In the menu, find a button that looks like a gear.  Click on it and another window will pop up.

  6. When you're finished, click done.  Next click on the button labeled "Display Google Chrome OS in this language."  You will have to restart the system for the changes to occur, but from then on, your computer will display the language of your choice.  Well done!
