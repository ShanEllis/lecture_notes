    "Chromebooks are used because they are cheap, portable, and have great battery lives. They are not used because they are clunky, useless without internet, and difficult to debug.\n",

    "I advocate for a custom chromebook setup involving using [SeaBIOS](https://johnlewis.ie/custom-chromebook-firmware/rom-download/) in order to dual boot ChromeOS and Ubuntu. By connecting a Ubuntu installed portable hard drive or usb thumbdrive to the chromebook, one is able to transform the device to one that is useful without an internet connection. An important distinction is that I'm referring to the full installation of Ubuntu, not the installer.\n",

    "The main impact of this project is using purely online resources to create a workflow for data science, and I agree that is the most powerful part of the project, but I strongly believe that having the option to practice and develop without using the internet is a necessity for our target demographic. A 128 GB usb thumbdrive can be procured for only $10-20, and the cost of these devices will go down dramatically over time.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Additionally, using old laptops discarded by educational facilitie and companies could also be a viable way to procure computers, as Chrome OS can similarly be dual booted from these machines.\n",

    "It would be super cool to have some kind of partnership with a chromebook manufacturer who could put custom identification stickers and install the open source bios system, though this is probably a pipe dream."

    "There are a lot of buttons and switches, but don't worry about most of them for now. As you use a computer you will eventually become familiar with the various parts and functions. The most important parts of your computer are the trackpad, the keyboard, and the power switch. Here are the three parts in short detail:\n",
    "- Keyboard: This is a photo of a keyboard, each key has an English letter, number, or symbol printed on it. If you press that key then the computer will output the corresponding letter. You can capitalize the letter, or choose the secondary symbol on a key by holding down the shift key while you type it in.\n",
    "- Trackpad: This is a photo of the trackpad. The cursor, pictured here, follows your movements on the trackpad. You use it by dragging one finger in a specified direction. A **click** is a computer command you activate when you push down on the trackpad and hear a small clicking noise. Use it to interact with objects on your screen. You can also **select** text by pushing down on the trackpad with one finger until you hear a click and *while continuing to press down on the trackpad* moving your finger. This will highlight the text that you have selected.\n",
    "- Power switch: This is a photo of the power switch, you may recognize the symbol printed on it. You turn on your button by holding down on this button for a few seconds. If the computer does not power on, try charging it and then trying to turn it on again in a few hours."

    "While the power button is used to turn on your computer, it is important you do not use the power button to turn off your computer. This has the potential to harm your computer if you are in the middle of an important update - while many computers have fail-safe systems it is always better to on the safe side. For now while you are learning, put the computer to **sleep mode**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sleep mode** is when your computer goes to sleep and uses less energy. You can activate sleep mode by simply closing your computer - it will automaticlly enter sleep mode. Leaving your computer on while you're not using it will drain its battery life. You can \"wake up\" your computer by opening it up, and clicking on the track pad once. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Charging\n",
    "The starter kit you were given should have contained the computer, a power cable, and this guide as a print out. Computer are run off of a rechargeable battery. Periodically you will need to charge your computer. This involves plugging in the cable to your computer charge port pictured here, and by connecting the power plug to an outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to ensure your computer is charged is by using it while it is plugged in to the power outlet, or by charging it every night. Alternatively your chromebook has a battery indicator pictured here. When the level is low or red, it is time to charge the computer."
