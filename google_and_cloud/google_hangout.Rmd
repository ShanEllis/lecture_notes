## What is Google Hangouts?

[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) is a communications service that allows members to participate in text, voice or video chats, either one-on-one or in a group. Hangouts are built into Google+ and Gmail, and mobile apps are available for both iOS and Android devices.

## Getting Started

You can access Google Hangouts by searching "Google Hangouts" on Google.com or by clicking on the start menu located on the lower left hand corner and searching for "Google Calendar". Both options should give you a screen similar to the one below.
