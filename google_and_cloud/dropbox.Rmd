# What is Dropbox?
Dropbox is a file hosting service that offers cloud storage and file synchronization. It creates a special folder on the user's computer, and all content inside that folder is synchronized with Dropbox's servers and all other computers and devices with the user's Dropbox account. Dropbox offers a free tier of 2 GB of storage and premium tiers up to unlimited backup and storage.
