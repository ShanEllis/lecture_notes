# Markdown editing tutorial

Like I explained in [my markdown tutorial]() editing markdown is very simple. While my advice for editing markdown on a non-Chromebook is to install a markdown editor, on a Chromebook you have two options - github or an online markdown editor.

You can create markdown files on github by ending your file with .md. For example if your file is called hello, then the file would be called **hello.md** and you would be able to view the result by clicking on the file directly. This kills two birds with one stone since you have no need to move any files. Unfortunately when following [our guide on version control]() you will see that this is extremely bad practice as if multiple people are working on the same repository then there is a chance that all your work will be deleted! One of our very own members lost his work because he was doing exactly this. Because of this you will want to use an online markdown editor.

The most popular markdown editors online are dillinger and stackedit, though any markdown editor will do the job. Since markdown is such a simple file format you should use the markdown editor that you like the best, since functionally they will likely be near-equivalent. Dillinger can be accessed at www.dillinger.io while stackedit can be accessed at www.stackedit.io .

Both websites are composed of two screens, one for typing and the other that displays the beautifully compiled text.
