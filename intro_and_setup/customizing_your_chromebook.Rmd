# Customizing Your Chromebook

  Now that you've gotten access to your chromebook, it's time to make it yours.  There are a number of personalization options available to you, lets go through some of them.
  
# Your Language

  You may be more comfortable working in another language.  If so, you can change your chromebook's language to match your own.  Here's how you do that:
  1. Go to the bottom left corner of the screen, as shown in the picture.  You will see a tool bar.  Click on it and a menu will pop up.

  2. In the menu, find a button that looks like a gear.  Click on it and another window will pop up.

  3. In this window, scroll down until you see some blue text saying "Show advanced settings..."  Click on it to reveal more settings.

  4. Scroll down to the Languages section of options as shown below.  Click on the button labeled "Language and input settings."  A new menu will pop up.

  6. When you're finished, click done.  Next click on the button labeled "Display Google Chrome OS in this language."  You will have to restart the system for the changes to occur, but from then on, your computer will display the language of your choice.  Well done!

# Your Wallpaper

Now it's time to express yourself.  Perhaps you want to change your background.

  1. Lets go back to settings.  Go to the bottom left same as last time.

  2. Click on the gear.
  
![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26655770/381a5130-462a-11e7-93d5-de069852d819.png)

  3. Under the section called "Appearance" you will find a button labeled "Set wallpaper..."  Click on that and you will be brought to another menu full of wallpapers.
  
![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26656673/061e2b62-462e-11e7-8e4c-ad52003508e5.png)

  4. This menu has a large number of wallpapers.  Choose one that you like then click on it.  It will automatically be set as your new background.
  
![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 6](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26656673/061e2b62-462e-11e7-8e4c-ad52003508e5.png)

  5. Didn't find one you like?  You can use your own images or find one online.  Download that image onto your chromebook.
  
  6. Next, in the same menu with the default wallpapers, click on the custom tab, then on the plus sign.  Click choose file then select your file.  It will be set as your background

![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 6 42 42 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26657705/84b2fffc-4633-11e7-80e7-70d3d20f521f.png)

Great!  Now we've got a background that is easy on the eyes.  Don't underestimate your wallpapers importance!  It will be the backdrop to the work that you will be doing for quite a while.

# Your Account Picture

You may have noticed the little frog that's been hiding in the corner of my screenshots.  That is my account picture (I think frogs are cute.)  When you first sign in to your chromebook, you will be asked to choose an account picture.  If you've already found one that you like, then great!  If you would like to change it to something else, here's how to do it:

  1. We're going back down to settings again.
  
![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26648773/93a80330-4611-11e7-8de6-b740610c052c.png)

  2. In the section called "People" click on the picture.
  
![screenshot 2017-05-31 at 8](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/28197711/26659715/ba6e9964-4640-11e7-910b-28cb289bcdbd.png)

  3. Now we have a set of options.  You can choose any of the provided pictures or your own.  Click on the camera button to take a picture of something using your webcam.  Click on the folder button for any other pictures that you may have.  This is also how you access pictures downloaded from the internet.  When you've found the picture of choice.  Click it, then click done.

Excellent.  There are plenty of other settings you can explore in the menues.  Try them out sometime.  And now that you know how to change your wallpaper and image, as well as how to set your language, you can change all of these again later as needed.

Great tutorial, I think would be good to good to have some exercises that would help the users, like providing a stock wallpaper and having them set it to that for practice
