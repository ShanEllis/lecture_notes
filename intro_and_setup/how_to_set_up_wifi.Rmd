# How to set up Wifi

## What is Wifi?
  Wifi stands for Wireless Fidelity.  A Wifi "hotspot" is the location of a router, a machine that can connect to the internet.  It emits radio waves to allow other nearby devices to connect to the internet.  And, as its name suggests, this is all done wirelessly.

## How does a Chromebook connect to Wifi?
  Chromebooks, like most modern laptops, have built in wireless adapters that can connect to Wifi.  Assuming your device is close enough to a hotspot, your Chromebook will be able to automatically pick up the signal.  Each source of Wifi is called a network.  When your Chromebook detects a network, you can then connect your Chromebook to the network and then can access the internet.  I will be going a little more in depth on how to do this in the next section.
  
## A step by step tutorial for connecting to Wifi

  1. Locate a source of Wifi.  Do you remember where Wifi comes from?  That's right, from a router.  These are not easy to find, and some networks are for private use only.  However, some businesses and other locations offer public Wifi.  Alternatively, you can use your own router.  How do you know where Wifi hotspots are?  That's simple, just open your chromebook and look in the bottom right corner:

  The icon highlighted in purple is the network icon.  It can tell you whether or not you're connected to the internet.  If the signal is full, then you're connected.  If it is empty (gray) then you're not connected.  This is also where you manage your networks; what network you want to connect to, which ones to trust, etc.  Click on the icon to take a look.
  
  2. When you've clicked on the icon, a familiar menu will show up.

  There in purple is the network sections.  It tells you two things.  First, whether or not you're connected.  And second, if you are connected, what the name of the network is.  In our example, we're connected to a network named "Thumbo Desu."  But let's say we're not yet connected to the internet.  Here's what it would look like:

  Notice how the icon is greyed out, and the words "No network" are where the network's name is supposed to be.  This, of course, means that we are not yet connected to the internet.  Notice also that there is a little arrow pointing to the right of the words "No network."  Clicking on it will bring up another menu.
  
  3. Now we are brought to a list of nearby networks.  Since Wifi uses radio waves, it can only be accessed in a short area around the router.  That's why even if you connect to your home network, it won't work if you go outside.  Scroll through the list to find a private network that you've been given permission to use, or a public network.  A private network is privately owned and not available to others.  These will appear with a lock symbol next to the network icon.  You will need a password in order to access these networks.  Public networks are available to all and require no password.  You will often find these in public spaces and businesses.  You are free to connect to these networks, but they are not as secure as a result.  Getting back to the matter at hand, once you find the network of your choice, click on it.  If it is a public network, you will be connected.  If it's private, you will be asked to enter the password.  Once you have, you will be connected.

Needs to include public wifi safety, typical ways that public networks make you authenticate (think starbucks), how to ask for wifi, etc.
