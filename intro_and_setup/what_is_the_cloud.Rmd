# What is cloud computing? 
Simply put, it is the storage and access of files and programs over the internet. Some examples of cloud storage is Onedrive by Microsoft, Dropbox, and Google Drive, where the latter also operates as cloud computing. Google Docs allows editing of text and word documents stored on drive, Google Spreadsheets can edit csv and Excel files, and Google Slides can edit powerpoint presentations on any computer with a browser and internet connection. Similarly, Microsoft Office 365 can edit files from their Onedrive cloud storage. Dropbox stores files in the cloud, but the files are synced to account owner's computer, where it can be accessed locally. Any changes are instantly propogated to the cloud and all files are updated.

# Chromebooks
Chromebooks are cloud-centric hardware. Unlike most Windows and Apple computers, the local storage in chromebooks is limited, usually up to 64 GB. However, they are paired with a hundred GB of free Google Drive storage and all of its programs. This lowers the hardware costs without hurting its productivity.

# Lesson Goals
At the end of this lesson, you should know what the cloud is and how a chromebook is designed around the cloud.
