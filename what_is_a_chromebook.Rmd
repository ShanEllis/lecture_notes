## What is a Chromebook?

A chromebook is a computer that runs Google's Chrome operating system.  This operating system works like other operating systems you might be used to, such as Apple OS or Windows.  It is essentially a version of the web browser, Google Chrome, and as a result is a lot lighter than other operating systems.
