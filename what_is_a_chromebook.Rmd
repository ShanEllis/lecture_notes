# Chromebook Tutorial

## What is a Chromebook?

A chromebook is a computer that runs Google's Chrome operating system.  This operating system works like other operating systems you might be used to, such as Apple OS or Windows.  It is essentially a version of the web browser, Google Chrome, and as a result is a lot lighter than other operating systems.  The advantages of having a chromebook lie in its easy maintenence, automatic updates, and fast start-up time.  It does, however, require a Google account to run.  We will be going into that and and other details in the next tutorial: "Getting Logged In."
