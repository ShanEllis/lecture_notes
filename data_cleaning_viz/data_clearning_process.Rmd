# why we need data cleaning #
Data cleanning can help us eliminate errors, eliminate redundancy,increase Data reliability, deliver accuracy, ensure consistency,assure completeness and provide feedback for improvements.

# how to keep data cleaning #
Generally, to do data cleanning, we need to follow five steps to keep data cleanning.
1. Plan.
First off, you want to identify the set of data that is critical for you and what information you do not necessarily need. 
It would be beneficial to create and put into place specific validation rules at this point to standardize and cleanse the existing data as well as automate this process for the future. 
2. Analyze to Cleanse
After you have an idea of the priority data your company desires, it’s important to go through the data you already have in order to see what is missing, what can be thrown out, and what, if any, are gaps between them.
Once you build out a list of rules or standards, it’ll be much easier to actually begin cleansing.
3. Implement Automation
Once you’ve begun to cleanse, you should begin to standardize and cleanse the flow of new data as it enters the system by creating scripts or workflows. These can be run in real-time or in batch (daily, weekly, monthly) depending on how much data you’re working with.
4. Append Missing Data
Step four is important especially for records that cannot be automatically corrected. Examples of this are emails, phone numbers, industry, company size, etc.
It’s important to identify the correct way of getting a hold of the missing data, whether it’s from 3rd party append sites, reaching out to the contacts or just via good old-fashioned Google.
5. Monitor
You will want to set up a periodic review so that you can monitor issues before they become a major problem. You should be monitoring your database on a whole as well as in individual units, the contacts, accounts, etc. You should also be aware of bounce rates, and keep track of bounced emails as well as response rates. It’s important to keep up-to-date with who is working at the company; so if a customer does not reply to any campaign in more than 6 months, it’s a good idea to dig a little deeper and make sure that that person still holds that position, is still at that company, or quite frankly, depending on how well you’ve maintained the database, hasn’t already kicked the bucket.
