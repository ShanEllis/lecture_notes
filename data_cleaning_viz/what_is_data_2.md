## What is data cleaning?

Data science is a surprisingly extensive field due to the greatly increased affordability of computational resources and large boon of interest in programming integrated fields. Due to being a hot "buzzword" in the industry, oftentimes the true meaning of data science can be obscured.

Data science is simply studying data to derive insight. Data science is not just making facy graphs and complex looking machine learning tools. In fact, the key jobs that most people will take in the data science field will involve data cleaning, a crucial part of data science that is oft forgotten.

In order to use data, one must first prepare the data. In the previous tutorial I described the different kinds of data that you might encounter. Unfortunately you will quickly come to realize that more often than not you will have to deal with the most infuriating data type possible - inconsistently processed data. 

Somtimes programs go wrong and accidentally input using the improper format, humans are notorious for accidentally misinputting (or even skipping inputs), and sometimes data gets corrupted. In any case, it is the job of the data cleaner to make sure that the data they are working with is consistently formatted throughout the entire document.

## The process
